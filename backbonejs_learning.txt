================================================= ODOO SPECIFIC ===========================================================
It addition to "frontend view" makes those changes in all the html files.
Also, ordering is very important, so be sure to load your file after the original.
This can be done using priority of View-Inheritance


ODOO also uses requirejs for this purpose. https://requirejs.org/	
	RequireJS is a JavaScript file and module loader. 

>In your JavaScript file, you call odoo.define(), which receives
the namespace you want to define as the first (addon's name) argument, and a function that contains the
actual implementation as the second argument.

The definition function receives only one parameter, require, which is a function you can use to obtain
references to JavaScript namespaces defined in other modules or in the core.
The object you return here is what other code gets when it calls require('yourmodule').












========================================BACKBONE=====================================
Web applications nowadays require heavy use of JavaScript to generate content on the fly. The user needn’t wait between requests and page refreshes. A lot of the logic/code that used to be on the server side is being moved to the client side.
JS allows web sites to render only content that changes without needing to reload the full-page on every request.

>_.js templates have the following syntax,

_.template(templateString, [data], [settings])
where in the templateString you use the place holder <%= %> and <%- %> to dynamically insert data. The later allows for HTML escape while the first one doesn’t. Moreover, you can use <% %> to run any javascript code

BACKBONE.MODEL
t contains the interactive data and the logic surrounding it, such as data validation, getters and setters, default values, data initialization, conversions and so on.

Another important aspect of models it’s that their properties are dynamic; they can be created on the fly and doesn’t have any specific type associated.

Collections allows to save data (in database, file, memory), and it requires a reference to it. Therefore, you need to specify the url parameter with a relative url, where the model’s resource would be located on the server

Basic Properties
There are 4 basic properties in a view: el, initialize, render, and events.
